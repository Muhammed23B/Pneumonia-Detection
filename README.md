âœ… Overview
Pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening lung infection. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The goal is to build a simple yet effective binary image classifier that distinguishes between Normal and Pneumonia-infected lungs.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Name: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
